### About me

A frontend developer with several years of experience. I'm currently working as a freelancer. In my work, I try to consider solutions to problems not only from the code side, but also from the business side, and find optimal solutions to problems. For me, the main thing is not to stand still, so if the tasks require learning something new: a library, a framework, or even a change in approach, then this is the best thing that can happen. I don't like to complicate things, however, simple solutions are not always the best either, so I try to find a balance here. I like to share knowledge, I can explain using the simplest possible examples and choose analogies so that anyone can understand.
